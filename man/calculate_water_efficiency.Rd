\title{Calculate Water Use Efficiency (SDG 6.4)}
\usage{
calculate_water_efficiency(withdrawal_m3, discharge_m3, recycled_m3)
}
\arguments{
\item{withdrawal_m3}{Numeric. Total water withdrawn from all sources in cubic meters.}

\item{discharge_m3}{Numeric. Total water discharged in cubic meters.}

\item{recycled_m3}{Numeric. Total water recycled/reused in cubic meters.}
}
\value{
A list containing:
\itemize{
\item \code{metric}: The name of the calculated metric.
\item \code{net_consumption_m3}: Net water consumed (Withdrawal - Discharge).
\item \code{recycling_rate_percent}: Percentage of total water use that is recycled.
}
}
\description{
This function calculates water use efficiency and recycling rates based on
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 303) standards.
