\title{Calculate Water Use Efficiency (SDG 6.4)}
\usage{
calculate_water_efficiency(withdrawal_m3, discharge_m3, recycled_m3)
}
\arguments{
\item{withdrawal_m3}{Numeric. Total water withdrawn from all sources (in cubic meters).
Must be a non-negative number.}

\item{discharge_m3}{Numeric. Total water discharged to all destinations (in cubic meters).
Must be a non-negative number.}

\item{recycled_m3}{Numeric. Total water recycled or reused (in cubic meters).
Must be a non-negative number.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{metric}{Character string. "SDG 6.4 - Water Efficiency"}
\item{net_consumption_m3}{Numeric. Net water consumed (Withdrawal - Discharge).}
\item{recycling_rate_percent}{Numeric. Percentage of total water use that is recycled, rounded to 2 decimal places.}
}
}
\description{
Computes water use efficiency and recycling rates in alignment with
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI 303) standards and SDG Target 6.4.
}
\details{
The function calculates the "Recycling Rate" as:
\deqn{(recycled\_m3 / (withdrawal\_m3 + recycled\_m3)) * 100}

And "Net Water Consumption" (GRI 303-5) as:
\deqn{withdrawal\_m3 - discharge\_m3}
}
\examples{
# Standard mining operation example
calculate_water_efficiency(
  withdrawal_m3 = 50000,
  discharge_m3 = 10000,
  recycled_m3 = 20000
)

# Zero discharge example (Closed loop)
calculate_water_efficiency(1000, 0, 500)

# Edge case: No water used
calculate_water_efficiency(0, 0, 0)
