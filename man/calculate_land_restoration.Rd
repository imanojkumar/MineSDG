\title{Calculate Land Restoration Rehabilitation Rate}
\usage{
calculate_land_restoration(disturbed_area_ha, rehabilitated_area_ha)
}
\arguments{
\item{disturbed_area_ha}{Numeric. Total land disturbed by mining activities (in hectares).
Must be a non-negative number.}

\item{rehabilitated_area_ha}{Numeric. Total land rehabilitated or revegetated (in hectares).
Must be a non-negative number.}
}
\value{
A named list containing:
\describe{
\item{metric}{Character string. "SDG 15.3 - Land Restoration"}
\item{percent_restored}{Numeric. Rehabilitation rate rounded to 2 decimal places.}
\item{unrestored_area_ha}{Numeric. Remaining disturbed land not yet restored (in hectares).}
}
}
\description{
Computes the rehabilitation rate of disturbed mining land in alignment with
SDG 15.3 (Land Degradation Neutrality). The function evaluates the percentage
of disturbed land that has been restored or revegetated and reports the
remaining unrestored area.
}
\details{
The rehabilitation rate is calculated as:
\deqn{(rehabilitated\_area\_ha / disturbed\_area\_ha) * 100}

If \code{disturbed_area_ha} is 0, the function safely returns 0 percent restored
to avoid division-by-zero errors.
}
\examples{
calculate_land_restoration(100, 40)

calculate_land_restoration(
  disturbed_area_ha = 250,
  rehabilitated_area_ha = 180
)

calculate_land_restoration(0, 0)

}
